# Leaf Disease Detection Model

## Background:
Plant health is crucial for argricultural productivity. Traditional methods of desease detection often rely on manual inspection, which can be time_comsuming and vulnerable to human error. Each year, plan diseases- ranging from coffee leaf rust to banana fusarium wilt - cost the global economy more than $220 billion. In fact, 40% of global crop production is lost to pests. Thus, with advancements in deep learning and computer vision techniques, there's a growing opportunity to automate and improve the accuracy of plant disease recognition.

## Data:
This project uses dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains images on three groups of leaves - healthy, powdery, and rust. There are a total of 1530 images divided into train, test and validation sets. The splits are as follows:
- 458 healhty
- 430 powder
- 434 rust

  
The test set contains 50 images of each group and the validation set contains 20 of each group.
