# Leaf Disease Detection Model

## Background:
Plant health is crucial for argricultural productivity. Traditional methods of desease detection often rely on manual inspection, which can be time_comsuming and vulnerable to human error. Each year, plan diseases- ranging from coffee leaf rust to banana fusarium wilt - cost the global economy more than $220 billion. In fact, 40% of global crop production is lost to pests. Thus, with advancements in deep learning and computer vision techniques, there's a growing opportunity to automate and improve the accuracy of plant disease recognition.
